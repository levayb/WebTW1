    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>About
      Impossibru is a reaction image based on a stillshot of an asian man wearing a bizarre expression and the caption reading
      "impossibru," which is typically interpreted as the Engrish equivalent of the word "impossible"
      (Japanese: インポシブル imposhiburu). Both the image and the phrase has been used to express one's surprise or exclamation
      across various forums and imageboard sites, and is notable as being similar to Rape Face.</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>The man shown in the original photograph is a Japanese comedian named Ayumu Kato, who became one of many celebrity
    victims in the popular hidden-camera prank show Panic Face King. In the episode, Kato is introduced to a group of
    businessmen (played by hired actors) under the premise of a business meeting. But as they begin their conversation,
    the three businessmen suddenly get shot down in front of him and a man wearing body armor enters the room to fire at
    the "snipers" outside. Kato falls to the floor in panic and moments later, another man enters the room with a gun, puts
    it to his head and informs him that he'd been punked by the TV show.</p>
    <h2>Spread</h2>
    <p>Spread
      Since its rise in early 2010, the "impossibru" image has been featured on various humor blogs,
      imageboards and forums, including FunnyJunk, Cheezburger, FAILblog and chan among others.
      There are also Facebook groups dedicated to the "Impossibru" man.</p>
