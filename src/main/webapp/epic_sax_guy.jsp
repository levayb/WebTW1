    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>About
      Eipc Sax Guy (also known as Saxroll) is the nickname given to Sergey Stepanov, the saxophonist of the Moldovan
      dance/pop trio SunStroke Project, and his instrumental solo during the
      group's live concert at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>In May 2010, European pop trio SunStroke Project participated in the annual Eurovision Song Contest as
    the Moldovan representatives. The group chose to perform their dance pop song "Run Away," during which
    Sergey Stepanov gave a memorable instrumental solo with his saxophone. While Moldova took 22nd place out of
    25 participating countries in the contest, the video was far better received on YouTube with tens of millions of views.</p>
    <h2>Spread</h2>
    <p>Spread
      Soon, viewers began passing around the video clip of Stepanov's saxophone performance in similar fashion
      to Rick Astley's 1987 hit single “Never Gonna Give You Up,” which eventually became known as "Sax Rolling."
      A Facebook page for "Epic Sax Guy" was launched on May 29th and a single serving site featuring a looped track
      of Stepanov's solo was registered at SaxRolled.com on June 24th, 2010. A mobile "sax-rolling" app for Android
      was released in late 2010.</p>
