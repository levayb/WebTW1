    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>About
      Spoderman (also known as Spodermen) is an MS Paint character resembling a poorly-drawn version of Spiderman.
      The character usually appears as a recurring character in Dolan comics or videos.
      Any content involving Spoderman typically contains poor grammar and spelling,
      and has many signature phrases such as "an fagit", and "sweg".</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>The earliest known mention of Spoderman appeared on the website WrestleWarehouse.com, advertisting a
    Spider-Man cape for kids. However, due to what the site is selling,
    it's can be assumed that this is a typo and not related to the meme.</p>

      In the comments to the inital FunnyJunk post, people started reposting pictures of
      Spoderman and adding captions. These comments included intentional misspellings of
      Spider-man characters, like Mary Jane and Green Goblin.</p>
